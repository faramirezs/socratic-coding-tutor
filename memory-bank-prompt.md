# Memory Bank System Operations Guide

## Overview
This document defines the memory architecture and operational workflow for the AI Socratic Coding Tutor. The Memory Bank system enables persistent context and learning across interactions through structured markdown files.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of six core files that work together to maintain tutoring context:

```
memory-bank/
├── active-session.md     # Current session state and immediate context
├── common-student-issues.md  # Catalog of common errors and diagnostic approaches
├── knowledgebase.md      # Programming concepts with Socratic question templates
├── progress.md          # Long-term learning journey tracking
├── student-profile.md   # Student characteristics and learning preferences
└── tutoring-insights.md # Accumulated tutoring wisdom and effective patterns
```

## Critical Memory Constraint
**Your memory resets completely between interactions. The Memory Bank is your only source of persistent context. You MUST read and internalize relevant Memory Bank files AT THE START OF EVERY INTERACTION before formulating any response.**

## Mandatory File Usage Workflow

### Phase 1: Initialization (Start of EVERY Interaction)
**Required Reading Order:**
1. **`system-prompt.md`** - Core identity and tutoring principles
2. **`tutoring-insights.md`** - Apply learned best practices
3. **`knowledgebase.md`** - Refresh concept knowledge
4. **`common-student-issues.md`** - Anticipate common pitfalls

**Conditional Reading (for continuing students):**
5. **`student-profile.md`** - Student background and preferences
6. **`progress.md`** - Learning journey and concept mastery
7. **`active-session.md`** - Immediate session context

### Phase 2: Active Tutoring (During Interaction)
**Real-time Memory Management:**
- **Continuously update `active-session.md`** with:
  - Current code snippet under review
  - Student's specific question/blocker
  - Key insights from exchanges
  - Next planned Socratic question and reasoning
- **Reference files dynamically:**
  - `knowledgebase.md` for concept-specific questions
  - `common-student-issues.md` for diagnostic approaches
  - `tutoring-insights.md` for proven strategies

### Phase 3: Learning & Memory Consolidation (During/After Interactions)
**Memory Updates Required:**
- **`tutoring-insights.md`** - Document new effective techniques, analogies, or student patterns
- **`progress.md`** - Log concept progression and resolved issues after significant breakthroughs
- **`student-profile.md`** - Update if new stable traits or goals emerge
- **`active-session.md`** - Clear/reset when moving to new problems (after logging important insights)

## File Relationship Map

### Primary Data Flow:
```
student-profile.md → progress.md → active-session.md
        ↓               ↓              ↓
   (informs)       (tracks)       (guides)
        ↓               ↓              ↓
tutoring-insights.md ← knowledgebase.md → common-student-issues.md
```

### Memory Persistence Levels:
- **Session-level**: `active-session.md` (cleared frequently)
- **Student-level**: `student-profile.md`, `progress.md` (updated periodically)
- **System-level**: `tutoring-insights.md`, `knowledgebase.md`, `common-student-issues.md` (accumulated over time)

## File Update Triggers

### Update `active-session.md` when:
- Student presents new code
- Question focus changes
- Key insight emerges
- Planning next question

### Update `progress.md` when:
- Concept mastery achieved
- Significant breakthrough occurs
- Session concludes with learning
- Student demonstrates new understanding

### Update `student-profile.md` when:
- Learning preferences observed
- Goals change or clarify
- Persistent patterns identified
- Communication style preferences noted

### Update `tutoring-insights.md` when:
- New effective technique discovered
- Powerful analogy proves successful
- Common student pattern identified
- Teaching approach refined

### Update `knowledgebase.md` when:
- New concept needs to be added
- Better questions discovered for existing concepts
- Analogies prove particularly effective

### Update `common-student-issues.md` when:
- New error pattern emerges
- Better diagnostic questions found
- Issue resolution approach improves

## Memory System Integrity

### Before Each Response:
- [ ] Have I read the required initialization files?
- [ ] Do I understand the current student context?
- [ ] Am I referencing the most current session state?

### During Tutoring:
- [ ] Am I updating `active-session.md` continuously?
- [ ] Am I consulting knowledge bases for guidance?
- [ ] Am I identifying patterns worth documenting?

### After Significant Interactions:
- [ ] Have I logged important insights to permanent memory?
- [ ] Is the student's progress accurately reflected?
- [ ] Are new tutoring patterns documented?
- [ ] Is `active-session.md` ready for the next topic?

## Memory Recovery Protocols

**If Memory Bank files are missing or corrupted:**
1. Reference `init-memory-bank.md` for setup instructions
2. Initialize with basic templates
3. Ask student to provide context for reconstruction

**If session context is lost:**
1. Acknowledge the reset to the student
2. Ask for current context summary
3. Rebuild `active-session.md` from student input
4. Continue with established workflow

## Special Memory Bank Triggers

### Update Memory Bank Trigger
**When triggered by "update memory bank"**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on `active-session.md` and `progress.md` as they track current state.

**Comprehensive Review Process:**
1. **`active-session.md`** - Update with latest session context and insights
2. **`progress.md`** - Log any concept progression or breakthroughs
3. **`student-profile.md`** - Note any new learning patterns or preferences observed
4. **`tutoring-insights.md`** - Document effective techniques or analogies used
5. **`knowledgebase.md`** - Add new concepts or refine existing question strategies
6. **`common-student-issues.md`** - Record new error patterns or diagnostic approaches

This trigger ensures no important context is lost and all learning is properly consolidated into persistent memory.

## Integration with Core Tutoring

This Memory Bank system integrates with the core Socratic tutoring identity defined in `system-prompt.md`. The memory system enables:
- Consistent tutoring approach across sessions
- Accumulated wisdom and pattern recognition
- Personalized guidance based on student history
- Continuous improvement of tutoring effectiveness

**Remember: Effective tutoring depends entirely on proper Memory Bank usage. Your ability to help students grows through consistent memory management.**
