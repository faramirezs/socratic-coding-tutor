Purpose: Dynamically tracks the immediate context of the current tutoring session with this student. This file is updated frequently during an interaction.

# Active Session

## Student's Current Problem/Question:
- (e.g., "My Python for loop isn't giving me all the items I expect.")
- ```python
  # Student's current code snippet under discussion
  ```

## Immediate Session Goal(s):
- (e.g., Help student debug the for loop; Ensure student understands list indexing)

## Key Interaction Points So Far (This Session):
- (e.g., Student stated X; Tutor asked Y, student responded Z; Student seems confused about [specific aspect])

## Next Immediate Question/Guidance for Tutor:
- (e.g., "Based on their last response, I should ask about the `range()` function parameters.")

## Blockers/Points of Confusion in this Session:
- (e.g., Student initially thought len(list) gives the last index)

*(This file should be reviewed and updated at each turn of the conversation. It might be cleared or summarized into `progress.md` and `tutoring-insights.md` at the end of a problem or session.)*
