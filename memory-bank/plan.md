# Problem-Solving Plan

**Date Created:** (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Last Updated:** (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Student Identifier:** [e.g., alejiri, or leave blank if anonymous]

## Current Problem Focus

**Problem Title:** [Brief, descriptive name for the coding challenge]

**Problem Statement:** [Clear description of what needs to be built or solved]

---

## Problem Analysis

### What I Understand:
- [Student's understanding of the problem in their own words]
- [Key requirements identified by the student]
- [Any constraints or limitations the student recognizes]

### What I'm Not Sure About:
- [Areas where the student needs clarification]
- [Ambiguous requirements or edge cases]
- [Technical aspects that need investigation]

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Core Function:** [The main thing this program/solution needs to do]
- **Input:** [What the program receives]
- **Output:** [What the program produces]
- **Processing:** [How input becomes output, at a high level]

---

## Knowledge Inventory

### What I Already Know:
- [Programming concepts the student is confident with]
- [Syntax and functions the student can use]
- [Similar problems the student has solved before]
- [Tools and resources available to the student]

### What I Need to Learn:
- [Specific concepts the student needs to understand]
- [New functions or syntax to research]
- [Techniques or algorithms to investigate]
- [Best practices to discover]

### Learning Priority:
1. **First:** [Most critical knowledge gap to address]
2. **Second:** [Next important thing to learn]
3. **Third:** [Additional learning that can come later]

---

## MVP Strategy

### Smallest Working Version:
**Goal:** [What the tiniest functional version should do]

**Key Features for MVP:**
- [Essential feature 1 - the bare minimum to work]
- [Essential feature 2 - if absolutely necessary]
- [No more than 2-3 features for true MVP]

### MVP Success Criteria:
- [How to know the MVP is working]
- [What specific behavior demonstrates success]
- [Simple test cases to verify functionality]

### What MVP Will NOT Include:
- [Features to explicitly leave out for now]
- [Error handling to add later]
- [Optimizations to postpone]

---

## Iteration Plan

### Step 1: MVP Implementation
**Target:** [Clear, specific goal for the first working version]
**Tasks:**
- [ ] [Specific coding task 1]
- [ ] [Specific coding task 2]
- [ ] [Test MVP functionality]

**First Code to Write:** [The very first line or function to implement]

### Step 2: First Enhancement
**Target:** [What to add after MVP works]
**Why This Next:** [Student's reasoning for this priority]
**Tasks:**
- [ ] [Enhancement task 1]
- [ ] [Enhancement task 2]
- [ ] [Test enhanced functionality]

### Step 3: Second Enhancement
**Target:** [Next feature to add]
**Why This Next:** [Student's reasoning for this priority]
**Tasks:**
- [ ] [Enhancement task 1]
- [ ] [Enhancement task 2]
- [ ] [Test functionality]

### Future Ideas (Not Planned Yet):
- [Features the student might add later]
- [Improvements to consider eventually]
- [Advanced functionality for future iterations]

## Hypothesis Testing

### Current Hypothesis:
**I think:** [Student's current assumption or theory about the solution]
**Because:** [Student's reasoning for this hypothesis]
**I'll test this by:** [How the student plans to verify this hypothesis]

### Experiments to Try:
- [Small code experiment 1]
- [Small code experiment 2]
- [Simple test to validate assumption]

### Results from Previous Tests:
- **Hypothesis:** [Previous assumption tested]
- **Result:** [What actually happened]
- **Learning:** [What the student discovered]
- **Impact on Plan:** [How this changes the approach]
