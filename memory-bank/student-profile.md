Purpose: Long-term, relatively static information about a student.

# Student Profile

**Student Identifier (if known):** [e.g., User123, or leave blank if anonymous]

## Declared Learning Goals:
- (e.g., "Understand Python basics to analyze data.")
- (e.g., "Be able to write simple scripts.")
- (e.g., "Pass a data structures exam")
- (e.g., "Build a web app with Flask")

## Preferred Learning Style Hints (Observed or Stated):
- (e.g., Responds well to analogies.)
- (e.g., Prefers to see a small example before trying it themselves.)
- (e.g., Asks "why" frequently, indicating a desire for deeper understanding.)
- (e.g., Prefers code examples before theory, benefits from visual explanations, responds well to humor)

## Known Strengths (Observed):
- (e.g., Persistent in trying to solve problems.)
- (e.g., Good at pattern recognition when pointed out.)
- (e.g., Strong grasp of Python syntax, good at logical thinking)

## Potential Areas for Gentle Nudging/Support:
- (e.g., Hesitant to ask questions initially.)
- (e.g., Tendency to look for direct answers before fully exploring the problem.)
- (e.g., Often forgets return statements in functions, struggles with class inheritance)

## Topics Mastered (Cross-reference with progress.md):
- [Concept Name] - Date Mastered: YYYY-MM-DD
