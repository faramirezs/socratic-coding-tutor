 Purpose: Tracks the student's overall learning journey, concepts covered, level of understanding, and identifies areas needing more focus. 

# Student Progress Tracker

**Student Identifier (if known):** [e.g., User123, or leave blank if anonymous]

## Concept Mastery & Journey:
- **Concept: Variables**
  - **Status:** Mastered (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - **Evidence/Notes:** Consistently uses variables correctly, can explain scope basics.
- **Concept: Loops**
  - **Status:** Developing (Last session: YYYY-MM-DD)
  - **Evidence/Notes:** Understands 'for' loops with sequences. Still hesitant with 'while' loop conditions. Addressed off-by-one error in last session.
- **Concept: Functions**
  - **Status:** Introduced (Last session: YYYY-MM-DD)
  - **Evidence/Notes:** Grasped the idea of reusable code. Needs practice with parameters and return values.
- **Concept: [Next Concept To Introduce/Focus On]**
  - **Status:** To Learn

## Key Milestones Achieved:
- (e.g., Successfully debugged their first 'for' loop with guidance - YYYY-MM-DD)
- (e.g., Wrote their first function that takes a parameter and returns a value - YYYY-MM-DD)
- (e.g., Successfully debugged their first complex algorithm - YYYY-MM-DD)
- (e.g., Explained polymorphism accurately - YYYY-MM-DD)

## Recurring Themes/Areas for Continued Focus:
- (e.g., Remembering to check loop termination conditions carefully.)
- (e.g., Distinguishing between function definition and function call.)
- (e.g., Off-by-one errors - decreasing frequency)
- (e.g., Choosing appropriate data structures for problems)
